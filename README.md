# 🎯 Design Patterns in Java – Rahul Jhamb

Welcome to my curated repository of Java design pattern implementations. This repo demonstrates hands-on examples of core design patterns using **clean code**, **testable structure**, and real-world analogies where applicable.

## 📁 Structure

Each pattern is placed under its respective category (Creational, Structural, Behavioral):

## 📌 Progress

### Creational Patterns
- [x] [Singleton](./src/main/java/creational/singleton)
- [x] [Builder](./src/main/java/creational/builder)
- [x] [Prototype + Registry](./src/main/java/creational/prototype)
- [x] [Simple Factory](./src/main/java/creational/factory/simplefactory)
- [x] [Factory Method](./src/main/java/creational/factory/factorymethod)
- [x] [Abstract Factory](./src/main/java/creational/factory/abstractfactory)

### Structural Patterns
- [x] [Adapter](./src/main/java/structural/adapter)
- [X] [Decorator](./src/main/java/structural/decorator)
- [ ] Facade (In-progress)

### Behavioral Patterns
- [ ] Strategy
- [ ] Observer
